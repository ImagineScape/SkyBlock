Just moved some code from Botania 1.16 to 1.15.2 and some Configs from Void Island Control from 1.12.2 to 1.15.2

What does not work?
- Structures in nether and end don't generate
- no teaming (might not come without help!)

What you can do:
- Fork it, but give Vazkii some credits, cuz it's 90% his code
- Yeah, do whatever you want
